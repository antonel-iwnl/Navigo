### Experimental 
This is an experimental library of HOCs. It is still in heavy
development and unstable. It is meant to make you work as less as
possible when mutating the state of your components. It aims to 
automatize absolutely all annoying and stupid tasks like 
```
onSave()
onCancel()
onChange()
and the list goes on
```

It is meant to be store agnostic, so you can use it with any store


#### TO think about
How configurable should HOCs be, use automatic store everytime,
let user set store?

#### TODO
Write docs for onChangeStore
Think of reliable configs for the library
